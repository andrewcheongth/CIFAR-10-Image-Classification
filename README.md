# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
Implementation and evaluation of CNN and ViT architectures for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to
1. Implement a CNN and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification using PyTorch.
2. Train and evaluate both models on CIFAR-10 under the same experimental conditions.
3. Compare model performance in terms of accuracy, training speed, computational efficiency, and generalization.
4. Analyse differences in learning behaviour between CNNs and ViTs using loss curves and attention visualization.
5. Discuss insights from the comparison, highlighting advantages and trade-offs of both architectures.
